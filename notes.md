# Chat GPT queries

## Prompt:

```
i have a mathematics question with a problem statement, options or string answer, difficulty, topic, correct response, solution, hint
and want to store it in my cosmos nosql database in a json format that should be easy to query
integrate the options and the correct response together into one object
Give me the data structure that is required here
```

## Response:

Certainly! If you want to store the problem with its various attributes in a NoSQL database like Azure Cosmos DB, you would typically use a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) document. Since you want to integrate the options and the correct response together, you could use an array to store the options, with an additional attribute to indicate which option is correct.

Here's a simple JSON structure for the data you described:

```json
{
    "id": "unique_problem_id",
    "problemStatement": "What is the sum of 2 and 3?",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "topic": "Arithmetic",
    "options": [
        {
            "option": "A",
            "content": "4",
            "isCorrect": false
        },
        {
            "option": "B",
            "content": "5",
            "isCorrect": true
        },
        {
            "option": "C",
            "content": "6",
            "isCorrect": false
        },
        {
            "option": "D",
            "content": "7",
            "isCorrect": false
        }
    ],
    "solution": "The sum of 2 and 3 is 5, which is option B.",
    "hint": "Consider using simple addition."
}
```

In this JSON document:

-   `id` is a unique identifier for the problem.
-   `problemStatement` contains the actual question or statement of the problem.
-   `difficulty` is a string that represents the difficulty level of the problem.
-   `topic` indicates the area or subject matter of the problem.
-   `options` is an array where each object represents a possible answer. Each option has an `option` field (like A, B, C, D), a `content` field with the text of the option, and an `isCorrect` boolean field indicating if the option is the correct answer.
-   `solution` provides the explanation or method of arriving at the correct answer.
-   `hint` is optional guidance that may help in solving the problem.

When querying this data structure, you can easily search by topic, difficulty, or even look for problems where a specific option is correct. If you're using Cosmos DB SQL API, you could write a query like this to find all easy arithmetic questions:

## Prompt:

```
Lets say I have user who has a name, email, phoneNumber,attempted problems, and a daily limit of 20 problems overall from any topic
Propose a datastructure to represent a user
```

## Response:

Here's a JSON structure that could represent a user in your database with the fields you mentioned:

```json
{
    "id": "unique_user_id",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
    "phoneNumber": "123-456-7890",
    "attemptedProblems": [
        {
            "problemId": "unique_problem_id_1",
            "attemptedOn": "2021-07-21T14:48:00.000Z",
            "isCorrect": true
        },
        {
            "problemId": "unique_problem_id_2",
            "attemptedOn": "2021-07-22T09:30:00.000Z",
            "isCorrect": false
        }
        // ... additional problems
    ],
    "dailyProblemLimit": 20
}
```

In this JSON document:

-   `id` is a unique identifier for the user.
-   `name` is the user's full name.
-   `email` is the user's email address.
-   `phoneNumber` is the user's contact number.
-   `attemptedProblems` is an array of objects, each representing a problem the user has attempted. Each object contains:
    -   `problemId`, which is a reference to the unique ID of the attempted problem.
    -   `attemptedOn`, which is a timestamp indicating when the problem was attempted.
    -   `isCorrect`, a boolean indicating whether the user's attempt was correct or not.
-   `dailyProblemLimit` is a field that indicates the maximum number of problems a user can attempt in one day, which in this case is 20.

This structure allows you to easily query and keep track of the problems each user has attempted, when they attempted them, and whether they answered correctly. Additionally, having the daily problem limit included within the user's document makes it straightforward to check against it before presenting new problems for the day.

For instance, to query the database for the number of problems a user has attempted on a specific day, you could use:

```sql
SELECT VALUE COUNT(1) FROM c IN user.attemptedProblems WHERE c.attemptedOn >= '2021-07-22T00:00:00.000Z' AND c.attemptedOn < '2021-07-23T00:00:00.000Z'
```

Remember to replace `user` with the actual variable or parameter that holds the user data in your query context. This query assumes the times are stored in UTC and that you transform the date to the correct day limits in UTC before querying.

## Prompt:

```
I have a node server written in javascript
I want to send the user questions in chunks of 10 at a time, the user should not get questions those are already solved by him/her
The questions can be filtered based on the topic or can be random but should not exceed the daily quota of 10.
Write the code for the server in js using all the npm packages required for this
```

## Response:

Certainly, to achieve this functionality, we'll require a few npm packages:

-   `express`: to set up our Node.js server.
-   `body-parser`: to parse incoming request bodies before your handlers.
-   `cors`: to enable CORS with various options.
-   `@azure/cosmos`: to interact with Azure Cosmos DB.

Firstly, you would need to install these npm packages by running:

```bash
npm install express body-parser cors @azure/cosmos
```

Now, let's create an `index.js` file for your server code. Below is a basic setup of the server to send 10 unsolved problems to the user, considering the user's daily problem limit and excluding the problems they have already attempted. This code does not include the actual connection and query execution against Cosmos DB for simplicity, but it shows where and how you would integrate with the database.

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const cors = require("cors");
const { CosmosClient } = require("@azure/cosmos");

const app = express();

app.use(cors());
app.use(bodyParser.json());

const endpoint = "your-cosmos-db-endpoint";
const key = "your-cosmos-db-key";
const client = new CosmosClient({ endpoint, key });
const database = client.database("your-database-name");
const problemsContainer = database.container("Problems");
const usersContainer = database.container("Users");

app.get("/getProblems", async (req, res) => {
    const { userId, topic } = req.body; // Assume user ID and optional topic are passed in the request body.

    try {
        // Fetch user details to retrieve attempted problems and ensure daily limit is not exceeded.
        const userResponse = await usersContainer.item(userId).read();
        const user = userResponse.resource;

        const today = new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0];
        const problemIdsAlreadyAttempted = user.attemptedProblems
            .filter((p) => p.attemptedOn.startsWith(today))
            .map((p) => p.problemId);

        const quotaRemaining =
            user.dailyProblemLimit - problemIdsAlreadyAttempted.length;
        const problemsToFetch = Math.min(quotaRemaining, 10);

        if (problemsToFetch <= 0) {
            return res.status(400).send("Daily problem limit reached.");
        }

        // Query to fetch not attempted problems.
        const querySpec = {
            query: "SELECT * FROM c WHERE NOT IS_DEFINED(c.attemptedProblems) OR NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(c.attemptedProblems, @userId) OFFSET 0 LIMIT @problemsToFetch",
            parameters: [
                { name: "@userId", value: userId },
                { name: "@problemsToFetch", value: problemsToFetch },
            ],
        };

        if (topic) {
            querySpec.query =
                "SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.topic = @topic AND (NOT IS_DEFINED(c.attemptedProblems) OR NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(c.attemptedProblems, @userId)) OFFSET 0 LIMIT @problemsToFetch";
            querySpec.parameters.push({ name: "@topic", value: topic });
        }

        // Execute the query against the Cosmos DB
        const { resources: problems } = await problemsContainer.items
            .query(querySpec)
            .fetchAll();

        return res.json(problems);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).send(error.message);
    }
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}.`);
});
```

**Notes:**

-   Replace `"your-cosmos-db-endpoint"`, `"your-cosmos-db-key"`, `"your-database-name"` with your actual Cosmos DB endpoint, key, and database name.
-   This code uses async/await and assumes you are using Node 8+ which is the minimum recommended version for Azure functions as of writing this.
-   Error handling is minimal to keep the example focused; in a production environment, you would want to have more robust error checking and handling.
-   The limit of 10 problems is hard-coded in this example, but you could allow this to be adjustable via query parameters if desired.
-   The code fetches up to 10 non-attempted problems. If a topic is specified in the request, it filters problems to that topic.
-   The code checks for the user's daily problem limit reached before fetching new problems.
-   This code assumes the user's `attemptedProblems` are tracked such that the `attemptedOn` attribute is an ISO formatted date string.

Remember to secure your API endpoints as required, using authentication and authorization strategies appropriate for your application.

I have a node server written in javascript
I want to send the user one workbook at a time which is stored in the ```workbookContainer``` in azure nosql cosmos database, the user has the number of workbook he already has fetched and should get the next one on request
Write the code for the server in js using all the npm packages required for this
````

## Response:

To achieve this functionality, you will need to use the Azure Cosmos DB SDK for JavaScript/TypeScript to interact with your Cosmos DB instance. Additionally, you'll need an HTTP server framework like Express to handle the incoming requests. Below is a basic implementation of a Node.js server using Express and `@azure/cosmos` SDK.

First, let's set up the Node.js server with Express:

1. Initialize a new Node.js project if you haven't already:

```bash
npm init -y
```

2. Install the necessary npm packages:

```bash
npm install express @azure/cosmos body-parser
```

Here's an example of what your server might look like:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const { CosmosClient } = require("@azure/cosmos");

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

const endpoint = "YOUR_COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT";
const key = "YOUR_COSMOS_DB_KEY";
const databaseId = "YOUR_DATABASE_ID";
const containerId = "YOUR_CONTAINER_ID";

const client = new CosmosClient({ endpoint, key });

app.get("/workbook/:userId", async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { userId } = req.params;
        const workbookContainer = client
            .database(databaseId)
            .container(containerId);

        // Assuming 'userId' is used to fetch the specific user's data and 'workbookNumber' is stored to track the number of workbooks already fetched
        const querySpec = {
            query: "SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.userId = @userId",
            parameters: [
                {
                    name: "@userId",
                    value: userId,
                },
            ],
        };

        const { resources: userWorkbooks } = await workbookContainer.items
            .query(querySpec)
            .fetchAll();

        // Assuming that 'userWorkbooks' contains an array of workbooks with a field that indicates the order (e.g., 'workbookNumber')
        let lastWorkbookNumber =
            userWorkbooks.length > 0
                ? userWorkbooks[userWorkbooks.length - 1].workbookNumber
                : 0;

        // Fetch the next workbook
        const nextWorkbookNumber = lastWorkbookNumber + 1;
        const nextWorkbookQuery = {
            query: "SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.userId = @userId AND c.workbookNumber = @nextWorkbookNumber",
            parameters: [
                {
                    name: "@userId",
                    value: userId,
                },
                {
                    name: "@nextWorkbookNumber",
                    value: nextWorkbookNumber,
                },
            ],
        };

        const { resources: nextWorkbooks } = await workbookContainer.items
            .query(nextWorkbookQuery)
            .fetchAll();

        if (nextWorkbooks.length > 0) {
            // Send the next workbook to the user
            res.status(200).json(nextWorkbooks[0]);
        } else {
            // No more workbooks available
            res.status(404).send("No more workbooks available.");
        }
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send(error.message);
    }
});

const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is up and running on port ${port}`);
});
```

Make sure to replace `YOUR_COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT`, `YOUR_COSMOS_DB_KEY`, `YOUR_DATABASE_ID`, and `YOUR_CONTAINER_ID` with your actual Azure Cosmos DB details.

This server sets up one endpoint that allows a GET request to `/workbook/:userId`, where `:userId` is a variable part of the URL that represents the ID of the user. The server expects that each workbook in the Cosmos DB has a `userId` field to link it to a specific user, and a `workbookNumber` field that indicates the order of the workbooks.

Please note that this is a very basic example. In a production environment, you would need to add proper error handling, authentication, and possibly rate limiting to prevent abuse of the service.
